After obtaining raw UAVSAR data, use polsarpro_t3_freeman.py to process the data and generate the three output files from the F-D Decomposition.
Then, use uavsar_geotiff.py to convert the outputs of polsarpro_t3_freeman.py, the individual polarization bands, and ancillary files (.inc, .hgt) to .tif format for use in GIS software/further analysis. Also generates a false-color RGB with the F-D components, with R = dbl, G = vol, and B = odd (sgl).
